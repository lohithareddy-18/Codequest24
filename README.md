Intelligent Student Counseling System

Project Overview
The Intelligent Student Counseling System (ISCS) is a comprehensive platform designed for universities offering diverse undergraduate and postgraduate programs. The system is aimed at identifying and addressing factors contributing to poor academic performance and student retention issues, such as low attendance, difficulty understanding course material, exam failures, health concerns, and financial challenges. By analyzing student data, the platform provides visual insights and tailored solutions to career counselors, enabling them to better support students academically, emotionally, and personally.

Key Features
Data Collection & Analysis: Automatically collects data on student performance, attendance, course difficulty, health, and financial status.
Personalized Counseling Recommendations: Provides three sets of tailored solutions per student focusing on academic support, well-being, and personal development.
Visual Insights: Graph-based performance evaluations for each student, allowing counselors to visually track academic trends and issues.
Intelligent Analytics: Utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze contributing factors to poor performance and provide actionable insights.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for easy navigation by counselors and administrators.
Performance Prediction: Predicts the risk of student dropout or academic failure and offers interventions to mitigate these risks.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Angular/Vue.js)
Backend: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL
Machine Learning: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Plotly, or D3.js
Deployment: Docker, AWS (for cloud deployment)
Prerequisites
Before running the project locally, ensure that you have the following software installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
MySQL/PostgreSQL database
Node.js for frontend dependencies
Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/lohithareddy-18/Codequest24/tree/main
cd intelligent-student-counseling-system
2. Backend Setup
Install Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the Database:

Set up a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
Update the database connection settings in config.py or .env.
Run Database Migrations:

bash
Copy code
flask db upgrade
Start the Backend Server:

bash
Copy code
flask run
3. Frontend Setup
Install Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the Frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm start
4. Machine Learning Model
Train the ML Model:

Place training data in the /model directory (data on student performance, attendance, health, etc.).
Run the model training script:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Save the Trained Model: The model should be saved in a .pkl format to be used in real-time predictions.

Usage
Counselor Login: Career counselors can log in with their university credentials.

Student Dashboard: View detailed academic profiles for each student, including grades, attendance, health, and financial records.

Performance Visualizations: Graph-based performance visualizations showing trends in student performance over time.

Counseling Insights: The system provides three sets of tailored solutions for each student:

Academic Support: Suggestions for tutoring, course material reviews, or exam preparation strategies.
Personal Well-being: Recommendations for managing stress, mental health support, and wellness programs.
External Support: Financial aid options or resources to help with personal and family issues.
Performance Prediction: Alerts for students at risk of failing or dropping out, allowing early interventions by counselors.

Intelligent Techniques
Machine Learning: The system utilizes decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to identify the root causes of student challenges and predict academic outcomes.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): For analyzing student feedback and counselor notes to provide further insights into student issues.
Predictive Analytics: Generates reports on potential risks, such as likelihood of failure or the need for personal support.
